Easily add custom warnings and errors to your Xcode project's build process

## Installation
```sh
$ gem install mayday
```

## Usage

Create a Maydayfile

```sh
$ mayday init
```

Add some warning and error checks to that file

```ruby
# Maydayfile

# Required
xcode_proj "CoolApp.xcodeproj"

# Use regular expressions to define errors or warnings on a line-by-line basis
error_regex "Please remove Copyright boilerplate", /^\/\/  Copyright \(c\).*$/, :files => "*AppDelegate*"
warning_regex "TODO", /^\/\/\s+TODO:.*$/
```

You can do more advanced checks, too, with blocks

``` ruby
# Maydayfile

warning :line, :exclude => "Fixtures/SomeDir/Excluded/*" do |line|
  line.length > 120 ? "Length of line #{line.length} is longer than 120 characters!" : false
end

# You can get the whole file, too
error :file do |entire_file|
  max_number_of_lines = 500
  
  number_of_code_or_comment_lines = entire_file.split("\n").select { |line| line.strip.length > 0 }.count
  if number_of_code_or_comment_lines > max_number_of_lines
    # Map line numbers to errors
    { "1" => "File is #{number_of_code_or_comment_lines} lines long" }
  else
    false
  end
end
```

When you're ready, run

```sh
$ mayday
```    

Next time you build your project, your errors and warnings will be flagged

Since Ruby is installed by default on OSX, the warnings and errors will work for anybody building your project, even if they don't have RVM, RubyGems, or mayday.

### Options

`warning`, `error`, `warning_regex`, and `error_regex` all accept an options hash with any of the following options

* `language` limits to files in the provided language. Accepts `"swift"` and `"objective-c"`.
  * `warning :line, :language => "swift" do ...`
* `files` limits to files that have an absolute path that matches the provided [globs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)). Accepts an array.
  * `warning_regex "Foo!", /^barbaz$/, :files => ["*.h"] do ...`
* `exclusions` doesn't run on files that have an absolute path that matches the provided [globs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)). Accepts an array.
  * `warning :line, :exclude => ["*/Pods/*"] do ...` **Note, Pods are excluded by default by mayday**

## Benchmarking

You may be concerned about how much overhead this will add to your build process. To see how quickly your `mayday` checks execute, use 

```sh
$ mayday benchmark
```

## Caveats

* `mayday` uses [sourcify]() to write your custom `warning` and `errors` blocks to a build phase, all [gotchas in sourcify](https://github.com/ngty/sourcify#gotchas) apply to your blocks.
* `mayday` copies your custom blocks, line for line, into a build phase, so all variables inside of them must be of local scope. Anything defined outside of a custom block will not be included in the build phase.
* Gems cannot but used inside of custom blocks, only vanilla, system Ruby.
* If your custom blocks have errors in them that aren't found until they're executed (which is done whenever you call `mayday`), the stack trace won't be very helpful in debugging (because there is no source map from the build phase back to your `Maydayfile` code)
* Generating efficient code to write into the build phase is difficult. The code generated by `MayDay::ScriptGenerator#to_ruby` could definitely be optimized.


## Uninstallation

```sh
$ mayday down
```
